borrow.rs:7:29: 7:36 error: capture of moved value: `numbers`
borrow.rs:7             for j in 0..3 { numbers[j] += 1 }
                                        ^~~~~~~
borrow.rs:6:29: 8:10 note: `numbers` moved into closure environment here because it has type `[closure(())]`, which is non-copyable
borrow.rs:6         thread::scoped(move || {
borrow.rs:7             for j in 0..3 { numbers[j] += 1 }
borrow.rs:8         });
borrow.rs:6:29: 8:10 help: perhaps you meant to use `clone()`?
borrow.rs:6         thread::scoped(move || {
borrow.rs:7             for j in 0..3 { numbers[j] += 1 }
borrow.rs:8         });
