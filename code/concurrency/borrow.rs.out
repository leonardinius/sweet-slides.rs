borrow.rs:5:34: 7:10 note: `numbers` moved into closure environment here because
 it has type `[closure(())]`, which is non-copyable
borrow.rs:5         std::thread::scoped(move || {
borrow.rs:6             for j in 0..3 { numbers[j] += 1 }
borrow.rs:7         });
borrow.rs:5:34: 7:10 help: perhaps you meant to use `clone()`?
borrow.rs:5         std::thread::scoped(move || {
borrow.rs:6             for j in 0..3 { numbers[j] += 1 }
